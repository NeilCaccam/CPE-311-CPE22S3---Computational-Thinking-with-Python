I followed the divide-and-conquer approach by first moving n−1 disks to the auxiliary tower, then moving the biggest disk to the destination, and finally moving the smaller disks on top of it. I used Python lists to represent the three towers, treating them like stacks by using append() and pop() to move the disks. I also sorted the source list in descending order so the disks start in the correct order and follow the game rules\n",
